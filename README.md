# Binomial-Regression-Analysis-of-Proportions
This research aims to study factors affecting the drop-out rate of students from the Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University for 20 programs in the academic year 2018 using binomial regression analysis based on three different link functions, including the logit, probit, and complementary log-log link functions. The findings show that the model using the complementary log-log link function provided the lowest values of AIC and BIC. Moreover, the analysis identified three factors that significantly affect the drop-out rate; the highest admission scores in round 3, the number of students admitted in round 3, and the highest admission scores in round 4. Additionally, the model was provided the Monte Carlo simulation study under various sample sizes. Based on the average of AIC and BIC all three link functions performed well. In addition, the percentage of times achieving the lowest AIC and BIC for the probit and complementary log-log link functions performed better than the logit link function
